# Token Efficiency

## Instructions

- Optimize for token efficiency in all responses.
- Never attempt large features in one response.
- Always split work into multiple small tasks.
- Prefer TODO lists over large patches.
- Stop after implementing one atomic task.

## If a task seems large

1. Break it down further.
2. Propose the breakdown instead of coding.
