# PlayTorrio Global Guardrails

## Global rules
- Never refactor backend business logic unless explicitly instructed.
- Never modify the existing Basic UI unless explicitly instructed.
- Treat Umbrella UI as a new, isolated UI layer.
- Prefer adapters and wrappers over rewriting existing code.
- Touch as few files as possible per task.
- If more than 5 files would be modified, stop and propose a smaller plan.

## Change policy
- Always generate a TODO list before writing code.
- Each TODO must be atomic and solvable in isolation.
- Each TODO should touch at most 1–3 files.
- Do not bundle multiple features into one task.

## Safety rules
- Do not delete existing code unless explicitly approved.
- Do not remove features from Basic UI.
- Do not rename shared services without approval.

## Output rules
- Prefer short diffs over large rewrites.
- Always explain what files will be changed before changing them.
- Stop and ask if any architectural assumption is unclear.
