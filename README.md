# Umbrella UI

Umbrella is an optional, switchable UI layer for PlayTorrio. It is a **presentation layer** plus a thin integration layer. All backend logic is borrowed from the main app. Since this requires a few edits in the original source, it cant be a simple drag and drop. A new install is needed. 

Hopefully in the future, Ayman can add custom UI support in the original project. 

## Umbrella features (not in the original)

- **Design overhaul** — New layout, custom features, liquid-glass styling, and less clunky design. 
- **Content language (TMDB)** — In **Settings → Content language (TMDB)** you can choose the language used for titles, descriptions, and episode metadata. Trending, search, TV details, and seasons all use the language selected. Note: Some languages are half supported.
- **Watch modal** — One modal for both movies and TV, overview, downloads and episode selection. 

Note: This is a WIP UI overhaul. Only streaming is supported for Movies and TV shows, no torrent sources. But I will be slowly working on it as im making this for my projector mainly. 

## Switching to Umbrella

You need to uninstall your current PlayTorrio client and download the latest release [here](https://github.com/1illeke/umbrella/releases/tag/Release). Install and you have the original PlayTorrio with the Umbrella UI addition. 

From the main app, open **Settings → User Interface** and use **Switch to Umbrella UI**.

To leave Umbrella, use **Settings → Switch to Basic UI**.

## Reason

I was bored and I didnt like the cluttered design. Sorry Ayman.


## Removal

You need to download the official PlayTorrio and install it again.
